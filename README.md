    <h1> Just Relax It </h1>
    Discrete variables relaxation
</div>

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation
For lots of mathematical problems we need an ability to sample discrete random variables. 
The problem is that due to continuos nature of deep learning optimization, the usage of truely discrete random variables is infeasible. 
Thus we use different relaxation method. 
One of them, [Concrete distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00712) or [Gumbel-softmax](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01144) (this is one distribution proposed in parallel by two research groups) is implemented in different DL packages. 
In this project we implement different alternatives to it.

## ðŸ“š Recommended stack
Some of the alternatives for GS were implemented in [pyro](https://docs.pyro.ai/en/dev/distributions.html), so it might be useful to play with them also.
  
## ðŸ§© Problem details
To make to library constistent, we integrate imports of distributions from pyro and pytorch into the library, so that all the categorical distributions can be imported from one entrypoint.
